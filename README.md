# TODO app

## What is this?

This app is designed only to test how good I understood the basics of Django. I decided not to use any tutorials but to create it myself. Any task can be attached to any group (marked with a colored tag). This app allows to
structure your tasks easily. Features:
- Group sorting
- Filtering by groups/tags/tasks/descriptions
- Days calculation until due date
- Users-related data
- Authorization and authentication
- An ability to change an avatar and background of an app

## Here are some screenshots of an app, so that I can remember in the future what I did...
